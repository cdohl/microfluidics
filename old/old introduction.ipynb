    "This and 2nd week material is covered in Pozrikidis chapter 1.4 & 1.5 .  \n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook demonstrating Stream-Streak-Pathlines shown i the teaser video is available [here](notebooks/Example%20of%20Stream-Streak-Pathlines.ipynb). It works only with a newer version of Jupyter than the one installed on Pulasan. Either download it to your computer with an updated Jupyter server or use it by uploading onto https://try.jupyter.org/.\n",

    "# Week 2\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Kinematics (15.8.2016)\n",
    "We repeat the concepts of streamline and pathline and introduce on the streaklines. Examples will be given. The pathlines can be calculated by solving the ordinary differential equation, yet in many cases no analytical solutions are available and we have to use a computer to obtain a numerical one. A standard technique is called the [Euler method](notebooks/02a Euler%20Method.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Flow field decomposition (17.8.2016)\n",
    "Using a lab based coordinate system is convenient but leads to the fact that the fluid particle's acceleration is not only a function of time, but of space, too. We derive the acceleration of a fluid particle at a point in lab space and name it [material derivative](notebooks/03 Material%20Derivative.ipynb). \n",
    "The [decomposition of a flow field](notebooks/04_Flow%20Field.ipynb) allows to quantify the deformation caused by linear straining, rotation, and shear.\n",

    "## Repeat and principle axis decomposition  (22.8.2016)\n",
    "We continued with the [last week's notebook](notebooks/04_Flow%20Field.ipynb) and describe the transformation of a shear flow into a linear straining flow by rotation of the coordinate axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rotating Flows (24.8.2016)\n",
    "Solid body rotation and the irrotational vortex are two kind of rotating flows in 2 dimensions. They are [discussed in this notebook](notebooks/05_Solid Body Rotation & Irrotational Vortex.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "A good video comparing both rotating flows [is available here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVKleybMn6I).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sources, Flow Rate and Flux\n",
    "\n",
    "The amount of flow going through and area and a line is quantified with the *volumetric flow rate*. [We derive the equations](notebooks/06_Flow Rate & Flux.ipynb) and quantify the source strength within a volume or area in the flow field.\n",

    "## Streamfunction, Velocity Potential, Laplace Equation\n",
    "The lecture slides [are available here](notebooks/pdf/BengHauLecture3108.pdf). We also discuss the numerical solution of the Laplace equation based on finite differences and an iterative solution scheme. Please have a look at the [Teaser video 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-oQvBgBRGM) which introduces the scheme for a simple and one dimensional problem before you [dive into the notebook](notebooks/07_Solving the Laplace Equation numerically.ipynb).\n",

    "Fluid Stresses at interfaces [are discussed here](notebooks/11b Fluid Stresses at Interfaces.ipynb). The stresses at a fluid interface are presented with a non-trivial example, namely the shape of a [droplet in a gravitational field](notebooks/12_Sessile droplet problem.ipynb). You may want to check out [an interactive notebook](notebooks/12a_Sessile Droplet Code interact.ipynb) to play with (does not work on pulasan yet). **Midterm exam!**\n",

    "# Week 9\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Navier Stokes equation](notebooks/13_Navier Stokes Equation.ipynb) is derived by choosing a suitable relation between rate of strain and shear rate, the so-called consititutive equation for a Newtonian liquid. We don't yet solve the Navier Stokes Equation analytically, yet we can use a [numerical solver](notebooks/13a_Navier Stokes example.ipynb) to understand the effect of viscosity.\n",
    "Next, we will derive the [Bernoulli Equations](notebooks/14_Bernoulli Equation.ipynb) from the N.S. equation. They allow us solving many flow problems mostly along a streamline. We solve the [collapse of a spherical void](notebooks/14a_Rayleigh_ODE.ipynb) as an example for an unsteady Bernoulli problem.\n",

    "# Week 10\n",

    "\n",
    "Then we will derive the flow around a sphere in the limit of [very small Reynolds number](notebooks/19_Stokes Sphere.ipynb). This provides us with an expression for the Stokes drag law. We'll compare the drag (pressure and viscous contributions) with the [ideal flow](notebooks/20_Potential Sphere.ipynb).\n",

    "\n",
    "# Week 13\n",
