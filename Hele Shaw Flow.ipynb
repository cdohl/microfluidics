It uses for this a different technique than the finite difference technique introduced [here](07_Solving the Laplace Equation numerically.ipynb). It is named the boundary element technique. This technique solves the Laplace equation through the knowledge of the potential and its derivative at the boundaries. Thus we do not need to discretize the whole volume but only the boundaries. This saves time and memory but leads to some more complex algorithm. If you are interested in this technqiue you may want to start reading [here](http://cav2012.sg/cdohl/CFD_course/bem.html)."
