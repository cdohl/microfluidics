    "### Question 1\n",
    "<img src=\"pics/inclined_flow.png\" width=500> \n",
    "\n",
    "* Derive the Navier Stokes Solution to the steady flow of a film of liquid of uniform thickness $h$ that flows done an incline (dark gray) under an angle $\\alpha$. Use the fact that there is no pressure gradient driving the flow (why?). Also set the $x$-axis parallel to the incline and choose a suitable body force.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Let the liquid be water and calculate the speed $v_x(h)$ of the free surface of the film in the case $h=100\\,\\mu$m und angle $\\alpha=30^\\circ$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "* Generate a fine spray, e.g. by spray bottle, in front of a dark background and illuminate the mist of droplets from the side with a lamp. Record the droplets that scatter this light with a camerea/handphonse and measure their sink velocity. Determine the size of the droplets using Stokes settling velocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "* Aerosols are fine droplets in the air that may contain viral load. In the current pandemic researcher are trying to understand the transport of these droplets. In a quiestence room with no drift (net flow) of the air, droplets may fall by gravity. Calculate and plot the fall time of an aequous droplet from $100\\,$nm to $10\\,\\mu$m spherical droplet in air for a distance of $30\\,$cm. Check and compare your findings with a recent [paper](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/05/12/2006874117). Comment critically this paper."
