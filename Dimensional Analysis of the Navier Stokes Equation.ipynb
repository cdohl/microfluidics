    "A flow is similar if the nondimensional parameters appearing in Eq. (11) are the same. That means, if Re, Fr, and St numbers are the same. Thus an experiment with the same non-dimensional numbers leads to the same non-dimensional solution (the dimensional solution is still different). It is very difficult if not practically impossible to keep all 3 dimensional numbers the same. Yet, for many flows not all of the three numbers are equally important. For example, gravity hardly is important for internal flows such as a pipe flow, or the flow around an object, while for surface gravity waves must be considered. Also for steady flows the St number is 0 and we only have to deal with a Re number similarity.\n",
