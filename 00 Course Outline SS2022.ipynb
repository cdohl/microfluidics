    "## Course Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the new semester, this time fully online. We start with an introduction of what fluids (gases and liquids) are and set the foundation for the first part of the course on *microfluidics*. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Week 1: General Introduction (11.4.2024) \n",
    "\n",
    "We will cover the administration and give an introduction into fluid mechanics and microfluidics in particular. \n",
    "\n",
    "Gases and liquids can be modeled with particles (non interacting and interacting). Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations help to understand their behavior and watch them in slow motion. To get into the mood of using averaged equations, I want you to play with a MD program. It can be [run in your browser](https://cdohl.github.io/md/md.html). For more information on how to run the program is available  [web site from Prof Schroeder](http://physics.weber.edu/schroeder/md/), please note that this version does not have the pressure graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get us all started, we rehearse some math. Please look and work through the [Math refresher notebook](01%20Math%20Refresher%20and%20Python%20Introduction.ipynb). This notebook also offers you with some first introduction into Python, the language we use in the course. A nice [introduction is given by Robert Johansson](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jrjohansson/scientific-python-lectures/blob/master/Lecture-1-Introduction-to-Python-Programming.ipynb). Don't worry, we will slowly start with it. I'll motivate the use of a programming language in the course, and besides learning fluid mechanics you obtain some skills which increases your employability!\n",

    "We have a short recap on the\n",
    "* [math](01%20Math%20Refresher%20and%20Python%20Introduction.ipynb) and the representation in Python\n",
    "then we'll look into the\n",
    "* [streamlines, streaklines, and pathlines](02%20Streamlines,%20Pathlines,%20Streaklines.ipynb) and use a [interactive example](Example%20of%20Stream-Streak-Pathlines.ipynb) before we look at the \n",

    "## Week 2: Intro to Microfluidics & Derivation of the Conservation of Mass\n",
    "\n",
    "Soft mathematical introduction to fluid mechanics. We start with the [material derivative](Material%20Derivative,%20Gaussian%20Divergence%20Theorem%20and%20Conservation%20of%20Mass.ipynb) and also introduce the *Gaussian Divergence Theorem* and the *Conservation of Mass*. It is important that you understand the [Eulerian description](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_and_Eulerian_specification_of_the_flow_field) of flows. We will start with the [Cauchy's Equation of Motion](Cauchy's%20Equation%20of%20Motion%20&%20Navier%20Stokes%20Equation.ipynb) for a continuum from Newton's 2nd Law of Motion for a deformable object.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Week 3: Navier Stokes equation derivation and first analytical solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "We insert the surface stresses for a linear fluid and through simplification obtain the Navier Stokes Equation for a [incompressible and constant viscosity fluid](Cauchy's%20Equation%20of%20Motion%20&%20Navier%20Stokes%20Equation.ipynb). Then we look at some solution of a [numerical flow solver](13a_Navier%20Stokes%20example.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Week 4: \n",
    "We discuss analytical solutions to the Navier Stokes Equation in [planar and cylindrical symmetry](Analytical%20solutions%20to%20steady%20and%20laminar%20flows.ipynb) and [Dimensional Analysis](Dimensional%20Analysis%20of%20the%20Navier%20Stokes%20Equation.ipynb).\n",

    "## Week 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Navier Stokes solution to an [unsteady problem](Analytical%20Solution%20to%20an%20unsteady%20flow.ipynb) (Stoke's first problem) and comparison with the CFD solver. For inviscid flows, we simplify the Navier Stokes Eq. to the [Bernoulli equation](Bernoulli%20Equation.ipynb). \n",

    "Application of the [Unsteady Bernoulli Equation](Example%20of%20unsteady%20Bernoulli%20equation.ipynb) for the collapse of a spherical void. Introduction to [potential flow](Ideal%20Flow%20&%20Solutions%20to%20the%20Laplace%20Equation.ipynb).\n",

    "## Week 7\n",
    "Derivation of the force on a sphere [in potential flow](Potential%20Sphere.ipynb) and in a viscous flow, i.e. the [Stokes Sphere](Stokes%20Sphere.ipynb) problem. We will also look at a viscous microfluidic flow with a potential flow solution, the [Hele Shaw flow](Hele%20Shaw%20Flow.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Week 8\n",
    "Microfluidic systems (Lab on a Chip) are composed typically out of inlets, outlets, and one or many connecting channels. In this lecture we will develop a strategy to describe these connected channel networks with a hydraulic [Resistance](Hydraulic%20resistance.ipynb). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Week 9\n",
    "We will look at the basic principle of diffusion and discuss several solutions of the diffusion equation in this [section](Diffusion.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Week 10\n",
    "[Capillarity](Capillarity.ipynb) is the force acting at interfaces between solids, gases and liquids. Here we'll start from the basic concept of the Gibbs free energy to the Young-Laplace equation and the Young-Equation. We'll see that a surface tries to maintain minimum area within the constraints set. We'll take a look at the rise and rise velocity of a vertical microcapillary and the pumping of liquid of an initialy dry microfluidic channel. If you want to dive further I strongly recommend the book [Capillarity and Wetting Phenomena](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-0-387-21656-0) by  Pierre-Gilles de Gennes, Francoise Brochard-Wyart, Davide Quere. \n",

    "Find the expression for the Young–Laplace pressure drop across a liquid/gas interface with surface tension coefficient $\\gamma$ inside a flat and very wide rectangular channel of height $h$, where the contact angle for the bottom and top plate are given by $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$, respectively.\n",

    "2. The dispersion relation $\\omega(k)$ for gravity waves is given by Eq. (20) in Chapter Two-Phase Flows](Two Phase Flows.ipynb).
