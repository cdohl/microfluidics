    "Welcome to the new semester, this time fully online. We start with an introduction of what fluids (gases and liquids) are and set the foundation for the first part of the course on *microfluidics*. \n",

    "## Week 1: General Introduction (6.4.2021)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will cover the adminstration and give a introduction into fluid mechanics and microfluidics in particular. \n",
    "\n",
    "Gases and liquids can be modeled with particles (non interacting and interacting). Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations help to understand their behaviour and watch them in slow motion. To get into the mood of using averaged equations I want you to play with a MD program. It can be [run in your browser](http://cav2012.sg/cdohl/ph3501/md/). For more information on how to run the program is available  [web site from Prof Schroeder](http://physics.weber.edu/schroeder/md/), please note that this version does not have the pressure graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get us all started, we rehearse some math. Please look and work through the [Math refresher notebook](01 Math Refresher and Python Introduction.ipynb). This notebook also offers you with some first introduction into Python, the language we use in the course. A nice [introduction is given by Robert Johansson](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jrjohansson/scientific-python-lectures/blob/master/Lecture-1-Introduction-to-Python-Programming.ipynb). Don't worry, we will slowly start with it. I'll motivate the use of a programming language in the course, and besides learning fluid mechanics you obtain some skills which increases your employability!\n",

    "[Capillarity](Capillarity.ipynb) is the force acting at interfaces between solids, gases and liquids.
