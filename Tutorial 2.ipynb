    "1. **Index Notation**\n",
    "\n",
    "  Use the index notation and show that the these are equalities:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. $$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i}(p\\,\\delta_{ij})=(\\nabla p)_j$$ \n",
    "  2. $$\\nabla\\cdot(\\rho \\vec{u})=(\\nabla \\rho)\\cdot \\vec{u}+\\rho\\,\\nabla\\cdot\\vec{u}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Flow Simulations**\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Write down the boundary conditions (b.c.) for the velocity $\\vec{u}$ and pressure for a flow in a 2d-tube driven by a pressure gradient. You need one b.c. for each boundary, i.e. the walls and the inlet/outlet, and component of the velocity. The pressure at the walls are determined by the incompressibility condition. For help look into the code.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  2. Do the same for a flow in a 2-tube driven by the upper wall. Again, check you answer with the boundary conditions stated in the code.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  3. Conduct simulations for pressure driven and wall driven flows. Try to obtain a parabolic profile for the pressure driven flow and a linear profile for the wall driven flow. Discuss the results. What is the effect of the time step of integration, and the CFL-number. Look up the meaning of the CFL number. \n",
    "  \n",
    "3. **Navier Stokes Equation**\n",
    "\n",
    "  The electrostatic force is a body force $\\vec{F}=q\\,\\vec{E}$, where $q$ is the charge and $\\vec{E}$ is the electric field. Add this force in the derivation of the Navier Stokes Equation and write a Navier Stokes Eq. with electrostatic body forces using a charge density $\\rho_{el}$ and the electric field $\\vec{E}$. "
