    "The material derivative is the derivative with respect to time of a physical quantity of a fluid particle described by field variables which are fixed in space.\n",
    "\n",
    "This sounds rather complicated, but isn't. Consider you want to measure the velocity field of a fluid. Most conveniently you fix the coordinate system with the lab and measure at fixed points in this coordinate system the velocity field. You thus do not measure the velocity of a single fluid particle moving through the fluid but the velocity at a specific point.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we relate this measurement for example to the acceleration a fluid particle undergoes? If the flow is unsteady, i.e. the fluid velocity is time dependent, then you may want to define an acceleration of the fluid particle at postion $\\vb{x}$ with \n",

    "Before you answer this question let's have a look at the following steady (time independent) flow.\n",

    "\n",

    "This is a called a fluid constriction. The fluid enters with a constant velocity from the left and exits on the right. Assume the fluid is incompressible, then the volume of fluid entering on the left must be equal to the volume on the right. Thus the volumetric flow rate is fixed over the whole configuration. The fluid entering from the left has a smaller velocity than exciting on the right. Therefore, after a fluid particle enters it will be accelerated while moving through the constriction. Remember, the fluid velocity *is not* a function of time, thus our acceleration as (wrongly) defined above would give us 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do it right, we need to calculate the acceleration of a fluid particle differently, and not only account for the change of the velocity in time but also in space. For above fluid constriction, the geometry leads to an acceleration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we derive in a formal way the time derivative of a fluid particle by using only quantities which can be obtained from a fixed lab based coordinate system. Describing a flow with a lab based coordinate systems is termed *Eulerian description*. In contrast if we fix the fluid particle and describe its change in time we use the technical term *Lagrangian description*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we look at the change of the velocity with space and time, we make our life easier by looking at a scalar quantity, e.g. the density $\\rho(\\vb{x},t)$. Consider we have measured the density of the fluid at every point in the flow using a lab based coordinate system.\n",
