    "\n",
    "Welcome to the new semester, this time fully online. We start with an introduction of what fluids (gases and liquids) are and set the foundation for the first part of the course on *microfluidics*. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Week 1: General Introduction (7.4.2020)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will cover the adminstration and give a introduction into fluid mechanics and microfluidics in particular. \n",
    "\n",
    "Gases and liquids can be modeled with particles (non interacting and interacting). Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations help to understand their behaviour and watch them in slow motion. To get into the mood of using averaged equations I want you to play with a MD program. It can be [run in your browser](http://cav2012.sg/cdohl/ph3501/md/). For more information on how to run the program is available  [web site from Prof Schroeder](http://physics.weber.edu/schroeder/md/), please note that this version does not have the pressure graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get us all started, we rehearse some math. Please look and work through the [Math refresher notebook](01 Math Refresher and Python Introduction.ipynb). This notebook also offers you with some first introduction into Python, the language we use in the course. A nice [introduction is given by Robert Johansson](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jrjohansson/scientific-python-lectures/blob/master/Lecture-1-Introduction-to-Python-Programming.ipynb). Don't worry, we will slowly start with it. I'll motivate the use of a programming language in the course, and besides learning fluid mechanics you obtain some skills which increases your employability!\n",

    "We have a short recap on the\n",
    "* [math](01 Math Refresher and Python Introduction.ipynb) and the representation in Python\n",

    "\n",
    "[In this Notebook](Cauchy's Equation of Motion & Navier Stokes Equation.ipynb) we first derive the Cauchy's Equation of Motion for a continuum from Newton's 2nd Law of Motion for a deformable object. Then we insert the surface stresses for a linear fluid and through simplification obtain the Navier Stokes Equation for a incompressible and constant viscosity fluid. Then we look at some solution of a [numerical flow solver](13a_Navier Stokes example.ipynb).\n",

You need one for each boundary, i.e. the walls and the inlet/outlet, and component of the velocity. The pressure at the walls are determined by the incompressibility condition. For help look into the code.\n",
    "2. Do the same for a flow in a 2-tube driven by the upper wall. Again, check you answer with the boundary conditions stated in the code.\n",
    "3. Conduct simulations for pressure driven and wall driven flows. Try to obtain a parabolic profile for the pressure driven flow and a linear profile for the wall driven flow.

    "[Capillarity](Capillarity.ipynb) is the force acting at interfaces between solids, gases and liquids. Here we'll start from the basic concept of the Gibbs free energy to the Young-Laplace equation and the Young-Equation. We'll see that a surface tries to maintain minimum area within the constraints set. We'll have a look at the rise and rise velocity of a vertical microcapillary and the pumping of liquid of an initialy dry microfluidic channel. If you want to dive further I strongly recommend the book [Capillarity and Wetting Phenomena](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-0-387-21656-0) by  Pierre-Gilles de Gennes, Francoise Brochard-Wyart, Davide Quere. \n",
